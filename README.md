# Maze Generation and Solving Algorithm Demo - NEA
Software to demonstrate 11 maze generation and solving algorithms, as well as providing analysis with performance metrics on each algorithm. Created with the intent of investigating whether any complementary generation/solving algorithm pairs exist, in which the particular style of maze generated by a generation algorithm particularly suites the solving style of a solving algorithm, and therefore performs better.
Written as an NEA Coursework for the A-Level AQA Computer Science course, awarded 71/75 marks. Written using Python, with the tkinter graphics framework.
